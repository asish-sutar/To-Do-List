# Task Manager Application

Welcome to my TODO application, a simple and efficient Task Manager to help you stay organized and productive.

## Features

### 1. Add Task
- This feature allows users to input and add new tasks to their TODO list.
- Users can provide a task title, description, and optionally, a due date or priority.
- After adding a task, it becomes part of the user's task list.

### 2. View & Edit Task
- View Tasks are displayed in a user-friendly format, showing details such as the task title, due date, and status.
- Users can edit a task to modify its title, description, due date, or priority based on their evolving needs.
- Editing tasks helps users keep their task list accurate and up-to-date.

### 3. Delete Task
- This feature allows users to remove tasks from their TODO list.
- Users may want to delete a task when it's completed, no longer relevant, or if they mistakenly added it.
- Deleting tasks helps users maintain a clean and organized task list.
